This project is a beginner-friendly command-line Hangman game developed in Python, designed to help new programmers strengthen their understanding of loops, conditional statements, string manipulation, and modular coding. The game selects a random word from a predefined list stored in a separate module and challenges the player to guess it one letter at a time within a limited number of wrong attempts. It keeps track of guessed letters, displays the remaining chances, and visually represents the hangman stages as the game progresses. Built using Python 3 and the random module, the code is organized into multiple files for better readability and ease of customization, allowing users to modify the word list or game rules effortlessly. This project can be run directly from the terminal or Google Colab, making it both an educational exercise and a fun, interactive program that demonstrates fundamental programming concepts in an engaging way.
